# Style Guide (v1)

Style locks to prevent rework:
- Characters: thick outlines, cel shading (2–3 tones), faces clean (minimal texture)
- Environments: slightly thinner lines; subtle paper grain OK
- Motion: output 24fps, animate mostly on-threes; action via impact frames + loops
- No floating HUD; all "systems" appear on Fold's map
